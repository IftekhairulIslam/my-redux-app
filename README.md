# React Application: Data Fetching, Caching and State Management

This branch demonstrates the hybrid approach for data fetching, caching and state management using axios, tanstack and redux.

## Used

- `Axios`: used for data fetching
- `TanStack Query`: used for data caching, retry
- `Custom Hooks`: used for data fetching and caching integration
- `Redux`: used for application state management (e.g.: filters)
- `Custom Service`: used for circuitBreaker, httpService and entityServices(e.g.: postService, todoService, etc.)
